## What's Interesting About This Dataset?
I chose this dataset because I would often think personally that reclining the seat is a **very annoying thing** to do when we are on the airplane. Those people are not considerate to the persons sitting behind them, leaving them almost no room by laying back.
Surprisingly from the dataset, however, a majority of the people think that it is not rude at all to recline their seats. More than half the number of the "**not rude at all**" group thinks that it is somewhat rude, and fewer people think it is very rude. This makes me think that people <ins>are not aware</ins> of their own behavior as impolite when laying back their seats-on the column chart, we see that there are a lot of unthoughtful individuals that take reclining their seats for granted without thinking how this action might annoy those seated behind them.
